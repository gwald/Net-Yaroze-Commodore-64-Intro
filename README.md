Net Yaroze code to make the playstation look like a Commodore 64 loading a tape game, with some ASCI art.

Thanks to Type79 (http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2820#p2820)

I used his bar code and played around with it to get a quick Commodore 64 intro, no audio but has ASCII art :shrug

It's for Net Yaroze, but shouldn't take long to add headers and pad stuff etc.

Here I'm loading it and adding sounds FX :lol:

It uses the FntPrint for text, which does the job!

Here's a video of it running:
